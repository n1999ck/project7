What I liked about Clojure:
1. The syntax actually felt pretty nice
2. It was easy to use built-in functions
3. The parentheses stuff made sense to me

What I disliked about Clojure:
1. It's not particularly well supported for IDEs
2. Like any less common language there's not as much out there in terms of tutorials, etc
3. The parentheses can definitely add up

What I liked about Haskell:
1. The repl worked well
2. When I figure out what I'm doing it's nice and concise
3. Great for smart people

What I disliked about Haskell:
1. Found the syntax much harder to pick up than Clojure
2. Importing was confusing
3. Weirdly bad ergonomics for typing, lots of stretching for uncommon keys like | or `

Overall I highly prefer Clojure
